# Google Maps Query Visualization

This project demonstrates how to perform simple geospatial queries against a Google BigQuery table that contains latitude, longitude data in columns. It also shows how to use the Google Maps Platform's Maps JavaScript API to present a visual interface for the queries and the query results. 

Inspired by a Codelabs at Google Developers site.
