This repository consists of files that I used to create the data visualization.

To be specifics:
1. TableauQuery.sql
- This sql file contain queries that I used for the data to be visualize
2. 4 Excel files
- These Excel files are data from the queries performed earlier
- I connect these files to Tableau Public for visualization
