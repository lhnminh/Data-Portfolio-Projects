# Covid Data Analysis

This repository consists of files that I used for this project
1. Couple of Excel files:
- Contain data gathered from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
- I splitted the data into 2 files Covid Death and Covid Vaccination
2. Covid_Project_Query.sql
- Contains queries to highlight key analysis of Covid Data Globally and Locally (United States)
